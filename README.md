ðŸ§® Task 1: Factorial Calculator
Description

This Python program calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.
It defines a factorial() function that computes the factorial using a for loop and returns the result.

Features

Defines a reusable function named factorial.

Uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of any non-negative integer.

Prompts the user for input and prints the result in a clear format.

Example
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120.

ðŸ§  Task 2: Mathematical Operations using math Module
Description

This Python program demonstrates the use of Pythonâ€™s built-in math module.
It takes a number from the user and calculates:

The square root of the number

The natural logarithm (log base e) of the number

The sine of the number (in radians)

Features

Uses standard library functions:

math.sqrt() for square root

math.log() for natural logarithm

math.sin() for sine value

Displays all computed results clearly.

Example
Enter a number: 25

--- Results ---
Square root of 25.0 = 5.0
Natural logarithm of 25.0 = 3.2188758248682006
Sine of 25.0 (in radians) = -0.13235175009777303
